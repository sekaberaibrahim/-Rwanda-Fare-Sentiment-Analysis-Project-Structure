ðŸ“Š Rwanda Fare Sentiment Tracker
Description:

This project analyzes public sentiment toward the recent introduction of a distance-based fare pricing system in Rwanda's public transport. The goal is to help policymakers and stakeholders monitor how citizens are reacting across multiple platforms such as social media, news sites, and public forums.

General sentiment trends over time (positive, negative, neutral)

The project delivers insights through an interactive dashboard and summary visual reports, supporting evidence-based decisions for improving the transport policy.
